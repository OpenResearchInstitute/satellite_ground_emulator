Demonstration files and documentation for AMSAT Symposium 2017

So far:

Includes is a 100kHz 80kilobaud  DVB-S2 signal experiment intended to demonstrate Cube Quest Challenge downlink. The signal is at 1.28GHz for bench testing. This is the initial draft and will undergo significant changes and development between now and October. Please contribute and document progress. 

Two modulation and codings are used in two stand-alone flowgraphs. "Small" station flowgraph is QPSK 1/4. "Big" station flowgraph is 8PSK 8/9. These are modified from standard GNU Radio example files and were transmitted with a USRP. They were received on a HackRF and a BladeRF with the receive flowgraph. 

The receive flowgraph relies on a Polyphase Clock Sync block. The FEC decode blocks are not yet complete. Current efforts are focused on synchronizing to transmitted DVB-S2 waveforms. We discovered a bug in the correlator that has been reported to GNU Radio. The out of tree correlator from gr-ais is under study as a model for replacement as it most closely resembles our particular use case.
